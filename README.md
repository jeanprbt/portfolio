# My personal portfolio

This repository contains the code for my [personal website](https://jeanperbet.com). It is built on [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), using [Three.js](https://threejs.org) to handle 3D elements, and it is mainly written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It features an organic moving sphere guiding the navigation, both dark/light modes, an animated menu and it is entirely responsive. Feel free to visit it!
