        "info": "My internship was split into two projects. First, I fine-tuned two small-scale LLMs to query a financial API from natural language inputs using sentence classification and named entity recognition, leveraging HuggingFace libraries. Then, I built a multi-agent pipeline with LangChain to process API responses and generate reports with visual charts, using cost-efficient LLMs.",
