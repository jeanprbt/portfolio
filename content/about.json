    "text": "I'm a Lyon-born 🇫🇷 tech enthusiast now chasing a master's degree in data science at EPFL 🇨🇭. I basically live for coding stuff, AI/ML experiments, and sometimes getting lost in my own CLI for hours. When I'm not glued to a screen, you'll probably find me smashing a tennis ball 🎾, cruising on a board 🏄, or drinking some beer 🍺. This little corner of the internet is where I dump some of my projects & experiences, basically the proof that I do more than just stare at code :)"
