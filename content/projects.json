It enables users to select multiple points to connect, computes the optimal path with a custom cost function and the A* algorithm, and displays the elevation profile. You can even export it to GPX, download it from the repo!"

We compared two architectures, namey U-Net and DeeplabV3+, trained over a corpus of nearly 700 images pre-processed for our needs, reaching a 0.81 F1-score on our best model. Feel free to try HF demo!"
