My work focused on improving and extending a test battery that monitored the status of multiple Ansible instances through pytest. In addition, I fixed various bugs in shell scripts.",

        "info": "My internship was split into two projects. First, I fine-tuned two small-scale LLMs to query a financial API from natural language inputs using sentence classification and named entity recognition, leveraging HuggingFace libraries. Then, I built a multi-agent pipeline with LangChain to process API responses and generate detailed reports with visual charts, using cost-efficient LLMs. "

This aimed at evaluating the impact of transitioning to Kubernetes as the underlying cluster management tool, and I measured no performance loss provided a suitable storage speed."
